This script can update the spring-example-project of the course material.
I wasn't sure if it was forbidden to have a docker-compose file for the updated project,
so I set one up for the spring project (cloned it and pushed it to my github with the file).
However, I couldn't figure out how to authorize the push any other way than running the script
interactively.
